NFL QB Analysis

### Repo To-do
1. Add list of package dependencies (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42237072/list-dependencies-in-python)
2. Add run instructions to README.md

### Pending Improvements
1. Update plotting to use preprocessing program outputs
2. Update plotting to interactive dashboard
3. Normalize per-game data to control for within-season effects (e.g. rule changes)
4. Elite-system-fraud with multi-category logistic regression
5. List comprehension vs apply for column creation??? Currently using apply, though this seems convoluted and possibly does not improve performance. Need to investigate further
