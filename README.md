NFL QB Analysis

### Repo To-do
1. Add list of package dependencies
2. Add run instructions to README.md

### Pending Improvements
1. Aggregate QB season stats to overall career
2. Normalize per-game data to control for within-season effects (e.g. rule changes)
4. Split QB record into three columns: qb_win, qb_loss, qb_tie
5. rename yds.1 to sk_yds
6. Plot QB DVOA, DYAR 
7. Update plotting to use preprocessing program outputs
8. Elite-system-fraud with multi-category logistic regression
9. Update how population is limited? Currently limit to primary starter seasons,
...might set a minimum number of total games or limit to DVOA qualifiers
